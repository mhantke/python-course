# Python Course

### Installation:

1) Anaconda with Python 3.7 (64 bit) (https://www.anaconda.com/)
2) Git (for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/)

### First steps with Git:

1) Go to https://github.com and register. Send an email with your username to *maxhantke@gmail.com*. Max will add this user as a collaborator to the online repository and grant write permission to the account. Accept the invitation to collaborate that is sent to you by email.
2) Open *Git BASH* - this is the bash shell that you will use to control git.
3) Navigate (basic commands: ``ls``, ``cd``, ``pwd``) to the directory where you like to keep your python code
4) Tell Git who you are by calling: ``git config —-global user.name “Max Hantke”`` and ``git config —-global user.email “max.hantke@gmail.com”`` (replace details with your own)
5) Make a clone of this repository by calling: ``git clone https://github.com/mhantke/python-course.git``
6) Check whether the repository was generated (call ``ls``)
7) Open your file explorer, navigate to the cloned repository, and make a copy of *session1.ipynb*. This copy is your personal notebook therefore append an underscore followed by your last name to the name of the new file (for example: *session1_hantke.ipynb*).
9) Open Anaconda and Jupyter Lab. Open your notebook and change the author line to your name. Save the notebook.
10) Go back to Git BASH and add the new file to the repository. For the example this can be done by calling: ``git add session1_hantke.ipynb``.
11) Commit your change to the repository by calling: ``git commit -a -m "added a new file"``.
12) Pull the most recent version from *Github* by calling ``git pull``. You may be redirected into an editor session, most likely *VIM*, to enter a commit message for the merge of the remote changes with your local changes. Just accept the suggested default message by saving and closing the file (in *VIM* type ``:wq``).
13) Push your changes to the *Github* server by calling: ``git push``. You will be asked to enter your Github account credentials.
14) Check under the tab **<> Code** (here on this webpage) whether your file was successfully uploaded to the online repository. Click on the file to check whether the name in the author line matches your name.

### First steps with Python in Jupyter Lab:

1) Open Anaconda and Jupyter Lab and open your notebook (*session1_XYZ.ipynb*). Don't edit *session1.ipynb* - this serves as a template for all participants. 
2) Carry out all tasks in the notebook.
3) Open *Git BASH* and commit and push your changes in your notebook.

### Create your own Git repository for session 4

1) Update your local repository of ``python-course``:
  - Open *Git BASH*, navigate to the folder where your *python-course* directory is, and enter it.
  - Commit your changes, pull, and push.
2) Create your own remote repository ``my-python-course``:
  - Go to the [Github webpage](https://github.com), sign in (if necessary), and go to your personal github main page (``https://github.com/``username``/``, replace "username" with your actual Github username).
  - Select **Repositories** and then **New**.
  - Enter ``my-python-course`` as a repository name and select **Create repository**. 
3) Initialise and sync your local repository for ``my-python-course``:
  - In *Git BASH* navigate to the parent directory of ``python-course`` by typing ``cd ..``. Confirm that you ended up in the correct directory by using ``pwd`` and ``ls``.
  - Make a new directory with the name *my-python-course* by calling ``mkdir my-python-course``.
  - Enter the directory by calling ``cd my-python-course``.
  - Initialise the git repository by ``git init``.
  - Copy the folder ``session4`` from ``python-course`` into your repository folder ``my-python-course``.
  - Add the new files for the course session by calling ``git add session4/session4.ipynb`` and ``git add session4/hsp165.txt``.
  - Commit your changes with ``git commit -a -m "first commit"``
  - Configure the remote location for the local repository by ``git remote add origin git@github.com:``username``/my-python-course.git`` (replace "username" with your actual Github username).
  - Initialise pushing and push to the remote repository by ``git push -u origin master``.
